## Favorite CPSC-120L Labs

    * Lab 6 Part 1
    I liked this lab because we made a system to make sandwiches. 
    We were able to choose our bread type and basically have our own
    custom sandwich. This part of lab 6 was pretty easy because we just had to make sure 
    there was 3 inputs and we just gave back the result of what you ordered. 

    * Lab 7 Part 1
    This lab was cool to do because we had to use standard time. 
    I hadnt really ever used that so It was cool to use it. I think 
    me and Cooper did a pretty good job even though we asked for a 
    lot of help and we had to redo some parts over and over again.

    * Lab 9 Part 1
    Me and Simon had a good time doing this lab because we got confused
    at some parts, but I think we figured it out in the end. 
    We made sure to check in with other people around us to see 
    if they thought we were on the right track.
